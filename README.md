#### Below is the set of SDK-based extensions patched to run in Pale Moon 27.0

According to the **official position of the Pale Moon development team**, such patching should be considered as hacking, and they cannot and **will not provide any guarantees** that anything will work or keep working; **nor** will they provide **any support for anyone running an SDK extension** that has been hacked to make it to run with the toolkit modules. **That includes all support, also for general browser use**, because SDK-sourced extensions may break the browser if forced to run.

Please, use these addons only as last resort measure! Better ask the developer of the original version to provide non SDK-based solution. Don't try to install all from the list or the extension you never used before. [See also ...](https://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=13745)
